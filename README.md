### 👋 Hi, I'm Kyryl

_Full-Stack Developer | Python & React_

I build systems that solve real problems—from distributed infrastructure to user-facing platforms. Currently expanding my toolkit with Go while working on full-stack applications.

### Projects

#### PyDataCenter | Datacenter Simulation Platform
[PyDataCenter5000](https://github.com/ITA-Dnipro/PyDataCenter5000)

A distributed system simulating data center infrastructure with role-based virtual machines (Web, SMTP, DNS, NTP). The architecture consists of two main components:

- **VM Agents** (Python 2.6): Lightweight monitoring services that track system health, collect performance metrics, expose health-check endpoints, and maintain bidirectional communication with the controller
- **Central Controller** (Django/Python 3.8): Web dashboard and CLI for real-time monitoring, command dispatching, and log analysis with integrated anomaly detection via an AI module

Infrastructure provisioning automated through Vagrant scripts.

#### Forum Project | Startup-Investor Matching Platform
[UA1303](https://github.com/Project-Stage-Academy/UA1303)

A web platform connecting early-stage startups with investors through structured project discovery and communication tools. The system provides differentiated workflows for founders and investors—startups can submit project profiles, pitch decks, and traction updates, while investors filter opportunities by industry, stage, and funding status. Features include role-based access control, commenting and review capabilities, and personalized content feeds to streamline investment discovery and visibility.

#### Other Projects
Feel free to explore my profile for additional work, including a [Transport Management System](https://github.com/ne0ascorbinka/transport-management-system) and various other projects.
