## 🌟 My Goals

🚀 With over three years of experience in the world of programming, I've cultivated a strong foundation in software development that extends beyond specific frameworks. During this time, I've gained a deep understanding of the entire development process, from conceptualization to deployment. My journey has included building and enhancing applications, exploring the intricate layers of modern software architecture, and delving into the world of databases, mathematics, and algorithms.

🐍 While my experience has not been solely focused on a particular framework, I've recently embarked on a dedicated path in Python development, with a particular interest in Django. This journey signifies my commitment to continually expanding my knowledge and skills in this exciting field. I am passionate about Python and its capabilities, and I'm determined to channel my three years of general programming experience into becoming a proficient Python Back-End Developer. I am eager to embrace new challenges, contribute to open-source projects, and further deepen my expertise in Python and web development.
